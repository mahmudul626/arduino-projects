The Vehicle-Activated Automatic Gate System is designed using an ultrasonic sensor, three LEDs (red, yellow, and green), and a servo motor to control a gate automatically based on the presence of a vehicle. Initially, the red LED remains turned on, indicating that the gate is closed and no vehicle is allowed to pass. The servo motor keeps the gate in the closed position (at 90°). When a vehicle comes near the gate and is detected by the ultrasonic sensor (within 20 cm), the red LED turns off and the yellow LED starts blinking. This blinking yellow light serves as a warning or "get ready" signal for the vehicle. After approximately two seconds, the yellow LED turns off and the green LED turns on, signaling that the vehicle is now allowed to pass. At the same time, the servo motor rotates to 0°, opening the gate. Once the vehicle has passed (simulated using a delay), the green LED turns off, the servo motor rotates back to 90°, closing the gate, and the red LED turns on again. The system then resets itself and waits for the next vehicle. This project demonstrates an efficient, safe, and smart traffic control system using basic components and automation.
